Trusted & secure 7.8 from 0 \u2013 10 á Our most popular destinations Orlando USA from US$6 per day Los Angeles USA from US$7 per day Las Vegas USA from US$8 per day Frequently Asked Questions How old do I need to be to rent a car? With many rental companies, you must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car, and any driver under 25 may have to pay a Young Driver Fee. Similarly, people aged 70+ may find some companies will charge a Senior Driver Fee, or may not rent to them at all. So car rental for the under-25s or over-70s can be more expensive \u2013 which is one more reason to book with Rentalcars.com, as we work with all the big brands. Just check each car\u2019s terms and conditions to see if your age would make any difference. Can I book a one-way car rental? Yes. One-way car rental deals are quite common, as they give people even more freedom to explore and enjoy their rental. However, rental companies will often charge a One Way Fee (or \u2018drop charge\u2019) to cover the cost of returning the car to its original location. As the world\u2019s biggest online car rental service, we can help you find a one-way rental car with a low Fee \u2013 or no Fee at all. Do I need rental car insurance \u2013 and what is \u2018CDW\u2019 anyway? Before you buy any car rental insurance, you should find out what coverage is provided by your credit card company, your homeowner\u2019s \/ renter\u2019s policy, and your own car insurance. This will help you decide what cover you need to buy while booking and picking up your car. CDW means \u2018Collision Damage Waiver\u2019; a type of cover that limits your liability for damage to certain parts of a rental car. How do I find the cheapest car rental deals? As the world\u2019s biggest online car rental service, we specialize in finding the cheapest car rental deals from major brands such as Hertz, Avis, Alamo and Budget. Daily, weekly or monthly car rentals\u2026 just fill in our search form to compare deals from different companies \u2013 and find out how much you can save when you rent a car from us. Any questions?

Loading... compare to rental You could rent a car (but that would be silly). Car rental is great if you don't mind standing in long lines. Not to mention, you're usually paying for gas, insurance and parking. But that's not what the Zipcar way of life is all about. With Zipcar, you're free from paying for all three (they're included) and your Zipcard opens the door to any Zipcar in any Zipcar city \u2013 whether you're there for business or pleasure. When considering rental cars over Zipcar, it's helpful to play a little game of \"OR\": Stand in line and wait for your rental car OR Skip jovially through the city waving to locals and whistling, picking up your car around the corner? Pay for gas and insurance OR Pay a low hourly or daily rate that includes gas, insurance and mileage? Race back to the rental lot sweaty and panicked to return your car before 5:00PM OR Extend your reservation using your mobile device, and then finish enjoying your dinner? Listen to on-hold music for 45 minutes only to learn that the rental office is closed for the day OR Call Zipcar Member Services 24\/7 and talk to a real person? Turn on the AM\/FM radio and adjust the mirrors on the four door OR Reserve one of our luxury Zipcars and adjust to being comfortable. And happy. this idea is bigger than all of us Imagine a world with one million fewer cars on the road. We do. á Fewer cars. Way Fewer.
